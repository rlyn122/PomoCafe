#Project Description:
Pomotime is a pomodoro timer that will help you stay focused for sustainable periods of time. The Pomodoro Technique is to work on a task for 25 minutes and take a five minute break. After four rounds, of 25 and 5 minute cycles, you take a 20-30 minute break. The Pomodoro Technique increases efficiency and incentivizes sustainable working/studying. This timer has many additional features such as a sign-in option that will keep track of your past sessions, a clean looking display, access to Spotify with Spotify API, and more! Hope you enjoy :)
